# Node-RED nodes for BMW ConnectedDrive

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/node-red-contrib-car-bmw.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/node-red-contrib-car-bmw)

This package contains nodes to easily connect to BMW ConnectedDrive and read out informations about your vehicles.

NOTE: These nodes are unofficial and do NOT COME from BMW AG. Be careful when using these.

Be careful not to send your login and password to anyone other than BMW or you are giving away the authentication details required to control your car.

Also ensure that you don't overwhelm the BMW servers with requests. Calling REST APIs at very high frequency can put substantial load on the servers and might get your IP blocked by BMW.

## Disclaimer

Use these nodes at your own risk. The authors do not guaranteed the proper functioning of these nodes.
This code attempts to use the same interfaces used by the official BMW ConnectedDrive web portal.
However, it is possible that use of this code may cause unexpected damage for which nobody but you are responsible.
Use of these functions can change the settings on your car and may have negative consequences such as (but not limited to)
reducing the available charge in the battery.

## Installation

Install using the managed palette from inside Node-RED.

## Usage

There are 3 new nodes which appear in the category 'BMW' in your Node-Red palette.

### BMW Action

Can be used to trigger a remote service on the car. This includes:

* Flash headlights
* Blow horn
* Lock door
* Unlock door
* Start climate
* Stop climate
* Find vehicle (Update location)
* Start charging
* Stop charging
* Change charging mode (Immediate charging or delayed charging)
* Change charging settings (Current limit for AC charging and charging target)

### Additional Information

* For these nodes to work you need a car with BMW ConnectedDrive support and remote services.
* The different types of data that can be read depend on the type of car. Different cars support different services.
* If you are getting an error response from the server with an 'http statusCode', then this code might be interpreted as follows:
  * 401: 'UNAUTHORIZED'
  * 404: 'NOT_FOUND'
  * 405: 'MOBILE_ACCESS_DISABLED'
  * 408: 'VEHICLE_UNAVAILABLE'
  * 423: 'ACCOUNT_LOCKED'
  * 429: 'TOO_MANY_REQUESTS'
  * 500: 'SERVER_ERROR'
  * 503: 'SERVICE_MAINTENANCE'

## Release Notes

### v0.7.0 - Captcha for token request

BMW introduced a new Captcha which now needs to be solved in order to login and to use the API.

Depending on your region, you will need a one-time token for the initial login that can be generated by solving a captcha.
         
Click one of the following links to obtain the token:

* [Rest of the World](https://bimmer-connected.readthedocs.io/en/stable/captcha/rest_of_world.html) 
* [USA](https://bimmer-connected.readthedocs.io/en/stable/captcha/north_america.html)

Paste it into the `Captcha` field in the config node, save, deploy the flow that is using this account. The token is valid only for a short period of time.

Also ensure that you enabled a persistent [context storage](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/context#context-stores) in the settings of Node-RED to preserve the login state, or you will have to solve a new captcha after a restart.
When multiple storages are configured, name the one to use in `Storage`.

### v0.5.3 - Start / Stop Charging

There are 2 new actions that allow you to start and stop the charging of your car.
The previous action called `Charge Now` is no longer supported by the API.

### v0.5.1 - New Charging Features

It is now possible to read out the charging settings using the *BMW Get* node.

In addition, there are 2 new actions which allow to change the charging mode and charging settings.

For the `Change Charging Mode` action the payload body must contain the charge and climate timer details to which the charging mode should be changed.
In this case the payload body must follow the object structure of the `chargeAndClimateTimerDetail` object returned by the *BMW Get* node for the data type `Charging Profile`.

For the `Change Charging Settings` action the payload body must contain the following properties:

```JSON
{
    "chargingTarget": <value in percent>,
    "acLimitValue": <value in amps>
}
```

* The `chargingTarget` must be a value between 20 and 100 in steps of 5.
* The `acLimitValue` must be a value as returned by the `chargingSettingsDetail.acLimit.values` of the `Charging Profile` data type of the *BMW Get* node. Typical values are: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 32, ...

### v0.5.0 - Upgrade to BMW v4 API

The version 0.5.0 introduced a major breaking change in order to upgrade to the new BMW v4 API endpoints. The old v1 version
of the API is discontinuied by BMW.
The returned data structure differs and mapping the data internally does not make much sense. Most data is similar but not all is the same.

Example of the structural changes:

| New data path (V4)                               | Old path (V1)                                      |
